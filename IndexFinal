            <p>I was born in Febuary, 2008 in Indiana.
                At the time we had lived in an apartment, but we moved into a house by the time I was 2 years old.
                Since I was so young, there isn't really another place I can associate with growing up other than our first house in Fisers.

            <p style="background-color: rgb(172, 233, 252);">
                The first house I lived in was in the perfect neighborhood. Alongisde being near the schools I went too, there was a neighborhood
                pool, park, and a forrest trail. Most of my time was spend outside, playing random games with our next door neighbors,
                some of which are still my best friends tody.

            <p>
                As I grew up, my interests began to shape what I would do from day to day.

                Here are some of my favorite things as a kid, with some extra details:
            </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Legos
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I loved making my own creations and the proccess of making sets was my favorite, as I was fascinated by the designs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you look ahead before reading this, you can probably assume that I was a big fan of Lego Star Wars as well.
                            </li>   
                        </ol>
                    <li>
                        Movies
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Star wars was my favorite franchises growing up, everything from the veichles to the characters, I though it was awesome.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I was also a big fan of marvel movies, especally Iron Man. I enjoyed the marvel video games too.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drawing
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Drawing characters or whatever inspired me was what I did most. While the drawings weren't amazing,
                                I enjoyed making them, and over time I got better as I grew older.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

            <h2 style="background-color: rgb(174, 255, 255);"><em>Modern Day</em></h2>
            <p>
                In present day, we have moved from the house that I spend my childhood in, but I'd say I'm pretty similar to who I was 10 years ago.

Its an oppurtunity to be creative, and similar to drawing, sometimes playing music can be a good way to debrief. I have the most fun playing music with my brother.

            <p style="background-color: rgb(199, 242, 255);">
            As someone who plays an instrument, I appreciate music very much. I enjoy listening to it whilst doing something creative, where music can be a driving factor as opposed to getting in the way of my thoughts. For example, if I have to read for an assignemnt and I'm listening to music with lyrics. So if I'm drawing, getting busy work done, or <em>coding a website for a project</em>, music is perfect.
