            <p>I was born in Febuary, 2008 in Indiana.
                At the time we had lived in an apartment, but we moved into a house by the time I was 2 years old.
                Since I was so young, there isn't really another place I can associate with growing up other than our first house in Fisers.

            <h2>Growing Up</h2>

            <p>
                The first house I lived in was in the perfect neighborhood. Alongisde being near the schools I went too, there was a neighborhood
                pool, park, and a forrest trail. Most of my time was spend outside, playing random games with our next door neighbors,
                some of which are still my best friends tody.

            <h2>Childhood Interests</h2>

            <p>
                As I grew up, my interests began to shape what I would do from day to day.

                Here are some of my favorite things as a kid, with some extra details:
            </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Legos
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I loved making my own creations and the proccess of making sets was my favorite, as I was fascinated by the designs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you look ahead before reading this, you can probably assume that I was a big fan of Lego Star Wars as well.
                            </li>   
                        </ol>
                    <li>
                        Movies
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Star wars was my favorite franchises growing up, everything from the veichles to the characters, I though it was awesome.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I was also a big fan of marvel movies, especally Iron Man. I enjoyed the marvel video games too.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drawing
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Drawing characters or whatever inspired me was what I did most. While the drawings weren't amazing,
                                I enjoyed making them, and over time I got better as I grew older.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul> 
       
            <h2><em>Modern Day</em></h2>
            <p>
                In present day, we have moved from the house that I spend my childhood in, but I'd say I'm pretty similar to who I was 10 years ago.

            <p>
                These are some things I enjoy doing, either with other people or just myself. Chances are, if I have free time, I'm doing one of these things.

                                Either it be on paper, on my ipad, or on my computer, I am always trying to improve and draw something new. I also find it relaxing, especially after doing homework.

                                I have a lot of fun playing music, I've never recording anything, but I usually just improvise and experiemnt with fun new scales or things I learn online. Its an oppurtunity to be creative, and similar to drawing, sometimes playing music can be a good way to debrief.
